# Python Fundamentals

About Me
My name is James, I'm 18 years old and I'm currently enrolled in Cloud Development at WSU Tech. I enjoy gaming,programming bots, and weight lifting in my free time.Botting is what intially got me interested in programming but learning all the new oppurtunites it can bring is what really excites me.

This is the first programming language that we are going to work with in our Cloud Development Course.
