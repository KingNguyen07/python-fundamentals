# Lab Exercise-My Application Overview
# 1. Write a function called simple(). Assign a different message to 5 variables
# and print each message.
def simple():
    message = 1
    print(message)

    message = 2
    print(message)

    message = 3
    print(message)

    message = 4
    print(message)

    message = 5
    print(message)


simple()


# Write a function simple 2(). Assign a message to a variable, then print out
# that variable. Change the message and assign it to the variable again, but
# after the 1st print statement. Print the 2nd message. Do these steps 2 more
# times. You should have 4 messages assigned to the same variable and 4 print
# functions showing the same results.


def simple2():
    message = 2
    print(message)


simple2()

# Stuck On Example 2
# I have no clue I spent 3 hours these instructions don't make sense
# I dont get how I'm supposed to change the message without losing the print
# variable.
# As for right now im just turning in as is, I don't have enough time left
# in the unit to dwell on one question for 3 hours,Moving on to All About Data


def message(firstname,lastname):
    """Print their last name first if given"""
    print(lastname,firstname)


message("James","Nguyen")
